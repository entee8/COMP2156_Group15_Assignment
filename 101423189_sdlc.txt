The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. DevOps plays a crucial role in improving the SDLC by enabling continuous integration and delivery.
DevOps tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes are widely used in the SDLC to automate processes and improve efficiency.
